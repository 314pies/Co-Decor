## Intro
Co-Décor is an AR application that allows multiple users to co-operate on prototyping the room Layout & Design quickly. 

While using Co-Décor, each user will use their own smartphone/tablet to join the same virtual AR space (aka - server on LAN) near them. In this space, the user first decides their base room boundaries, then uses predefined prefabs (such as TV, tables, cabinet, lamps...etc.) to prototype the layout with their desired design.

Compared to traditional interfaces (e.g., desktop computer, pure touchscreen, etc.), this will provide a more convenient and intuitive way for users to co-operate in such a virtual 3D environment. And also give the users a more accurate feeling of what the final design will look like. 
  

*Built with Unity, ARFoundation, and Mirror Framework.*
